          Why Do I Apply to Hundreds of Jobs but Receive No Responses?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">The answer is that ATS often rejects your resume.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          In today's competitive job market, many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to
          streamline their hiring processes. This software is designed to filter out resumes from
          hundreds or thousands, selecting only those from relevant and qualified candidates. If
          your resume lacks the right keywords or formatting, it may never reach an HR
          representative. Many people apply for hundreds of jobs but receive no responses, leading
          to frustration. According to studies, it's estimated that around 70% of resumes are never
          seen by human eyes because they fail to pass through these automated filters.

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          ATS has its own algorithms. These algorithms scan resumes and filter them based on
          specific keywords, experience, skills, and other qualifications. HR sets certain criteria
          for a specific position, and ATS sorts resumes that match those criteria.
